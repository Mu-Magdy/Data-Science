## Introduction

The code in this notebook addresses an image enhancement task, specifically sharpening blurred images using a U-Net model. The notebook includes steps for importing necessary libraries, loading and preprocessing images, building and training the U-Net model, and evaluating the results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pillow (PIL)
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow

You can install these libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas Pillow matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Installation

 - Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mu-Magdy/Data-Science.git/

cd Blnk Task
```

-  Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash

```
jupyter notebook Blnk_image_inhancement_task.ipynb
```

## Usage
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code. The notebook includes sections for importing libraries, setting global variables, unzipping image files, loading images, preprocessing, building the U-Net model, training, and evaluating the model.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations of original, blurred, and sharpened images. Additionally, it discusses the limitations of the U-Net model for image enhancement and suggests further steps for improvement, such as exploring different architectures or using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
